## Introduction

Water quality is an essential aspect of public health. This machine learning project aims to classify water samples as potable or non-potable based on various features, such as pH, solids, and more. It explores different machine learning algorithms, performs data analysis, and evaluates model performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is available [here](/kaggle/input/water-quality-and-potability/water_potability.csv). It contains information about water quality attributes and whether the water is potable or not.

## Usage

This project can serve as a starting point for anyone interested in water quality classification tasks. You can use the provided code to:

- Explore and preprocess the dataset.
- Train and evaluate various machine learning models.
- Visualize the results using ROC curves, Precision-Recall curves, and other plots.
